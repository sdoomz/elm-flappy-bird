{-| A library for animating between two `Float` values. For example, animate a panel's width from 100px to 300px over 2
seconds, or make a button spin and grow on hover. Everything is a pure function (no signals or tasks), so you can use it
easily within your architecture. You can also inspect animations to determine if they are still running and for how
long, and even smoothly retarget a different destination midflight.

The library encapsulates a 3-stage animation pipeline:

* **Timekeeping:** Creating and running an animation requires the current time, which is best obtained with
    [`AnimationFrame.times`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/animation-frame/latest/AnimationFrame#times).
    You can also specify the duration of animation, and delay it prior to starting.

* **Easing:** An easing function makes an animation come alive with acceleration or even elasticity. You can find all
    kinds of crazy easing functions in [this library](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/easing-functions/latest/Ease).

* **Interpolation:** It wouldn't be very useful is all animations went from 0 to 1 (the default), would it? You can
    specify values to animate `from` and `to`. Furthermore, you can set the average speed (distance between these two
    values per milisecond) instead of a duration.

Once you have your value at the current time, you can render it to any frontend you choose: Collage, Element, Html,
[Turtles](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mgold/elm-turtle-graphics/latest)...

## Basic Usage
`animation` creates an animation starting at the given time (usually the current time). `animate` takes the current time
and an animation, and produces the current value. Animations go through three phases (not related to the three stages of
rendering): they are scheduled, they run, and then they are done.

````elm
import Animation exposing (..)
import Time exposing (second)

myAnim = animation 0 |> from 100 |> to 300 |> duration (4*second) |> delay (1*second)
List.map (\t -> animate (t*second) myAnim) [0..6]
-- [100, 100, 129.29, 200, 270.71, 300, 300]
````

Notice that the value remains constant during the delay and after the animation is done. You can also use `static` to
create animations of constant value. By using these two degenerate cases, you ought to be able to keep animations in
your model without worrying about when they aren't actually animating.

{-| Run an animation in reverse from its current state, beginning immediately (even if the animation was delayed or has
been done for a while).

Usually you don't want to undo an animation that has been retargeted; just retarget it again. Similarly, undoing an
undone animation is frequently not what you want.
-}

      , ramp = Nothing
      , ease = (\t -> 1 - (a.ease (1 - t)))
    }


{-| Change the `to` value of a running animation, without an abrupt change in velocity. The easing function will be
retained (but you can change it with `ease`). The animation will retain its average speed (but not necessarily
duration). If you retarget multiple animations at once (e.g. x and y), you will need to sync their durations (perhaps to
the `timeRemaining` in the old animations).

If the retargeted animation is still scheduled, the `to` value is replaced. If it's already done, `from` becomes the
old `to`, `to` and `start` are set to the values provided, and the delay is set to zero. If the old and new `to` values
are the same, the animation is unchanged.

{-| Set the duration of an animation to the time specified. Note that the `Time` argument is _not_ the current running
time but the duration to be set.
-}
duration : Time -> Animation -> Animation
duration x (A a) =
  A { a | dos = Duration x }


{-| Set the _average_ speed of an animation. Speed is the rate at which the animation progresses between the `from` and
`to` values per milisecond. Most easing functions will deviate from the average speed. You do not need to worry about
the sign. It is safe to alter the `from` and `to` values after setting speed.
-}
speed : Float -> Animation -> Animation
speed x (A a) =
  A { a | dos = Speed (abs x) }


{-| Set the delay of an animation to the time specified. An animation will not start until after the delay. The default
delay is 0. Note that the `Time` argument is _not_ the current running time but the delay to be set.
-}
delay : Time -> Animation -> Animation
delay x (A a) =

{-| Set the easing function of an animation. It is expected that `f 0 == 0` and `f 1 == 1`. The default is a sinusoidal
in-out.

For animations that are already running, use `retarget`.
-}
to : Float -> Animation -> Animation
to x (A a) =
  A { a | to = x, ramp = Nothing }


{-| Get the time elapsed since the animation started playing (after the end of delay). Will be zero for animations that
are still scheduled, and is not bounded for animations that are already done.
-}
timeElapsed : Time -> Animation -> Time
timeElapsed t (A { start, delay }) =
  t - (start + delay) |> max 0


{-| Get the time that the animation has yet to play (or be delayed) before becoming done. Will be zero for animations
that are already done.
-}
timeRemaining : Time -> Animation -> Time
timeRemaining t (A { start, delay, dos, from, to }) =
  let
    duration =
      dur dos from to
  in
    start + delay + duration - t |> max 0


{-| Get the _current_ velocity of the animation, aproximated by looking 10ms forwards and backwards (the central
difference). The velocity may be negative.

velocity : Time -> Animation -> Float

    forwDiff =
      animate (t + 10) u
  in
    (forwDiff - backDiff) / 20


{-| Get the start time of the animation, not accounting for delay. For animations created with `animate`, this is the
argument that was passed. For interrupted animations, this is when the interruption occured.

getEase (A a) =

getFrom (A a) =

{-| Get the final value of the animation.

getTo : Animation -> Float
getTo (A a) =
  a.to


{-| Equality on animations. Compared to `(==)` (which should not be used), this
function handles the conversion of speed and duration, and start and delay. It
also samples the easing functions, which may produce false positives (but
usually not in practice).
